I developed my program by breaking down the problem into pieces. I started by creating code for the probability calculation that gave the exact probability of the experiment. Calculating the exact probability was simple after you explained it to us. Since it is easier to calculate the probability of a group of people each having a different birthday, I attacked it that way. If you had a group of people you wanted to calculate the probability of having the same birthday, you have to start with one of their birthday's to compare to the others. Automatically, you start with 364/365 birthdays, then subtract one for every person in the group (excluding the first person). From there, I used your "Algorithm" explanation on the board to create the loops in the main method. Once you explained to me that I was creating an array of 0's that would change to 1's once I picked them, it became easier to create an outer loop that iterated based on the number of experiments, and an inner loop based on the number of people in each experiment. Then, I went on to account for the correct arguments, this was the hardest part for me. I tried to account for all exceptions that could be thrown by testing whether or not an argument was entered at all, whether or not the argument was an integer, and if the second argument was entered incorrectly/not at all, that it would default to 100,000. What helped my mental analysis the most for creating the main method loop (which was the hardest part of the calculation to make), was thinking about it in terms of you have 100,000 rooms and 23 people in each room. That example allowed me to understand that within each experiment, I was testing the probability that N number of people had the same birthday.
