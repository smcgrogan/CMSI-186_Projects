==========
WOW, Summer, VERY good work on this one!  Your code is lovely, looks well-planned
and well-executed.  I like the "approX" name...  *grin*

I made a copy of your shell script to a batch file so I could run it under windows,
and I changed your header to include "REM" statements, which is how windows batch
files do comments.  Otherwise I left it alone.

Unfortunately there are only 12 tests in there and you were supposed to do 20, so
I had to take a couple of points off.  Nevertheless, you did a WONDERFUL job on
this and you should be very proud of the progress you have made in this class!!

VERY Nice work!
